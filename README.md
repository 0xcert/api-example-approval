This is an example of how to 0xcertAPI deployments.

The example is wrapped in a simple dApp to showcase not only functionalities but also the basic principles of handling blockchain communication through 0xcertAPI. Main logic is isolated in `src/example.ts` while response handling is located in `index.ts`.

Project stucture:

| Path | Description
|-|-
| src/example.ts | Main logic showing the use.
| src/config.ts | Configuration file.
| index.html | Front end styling.
| index.ts | Controller connecting front end to the logic.
| package.json | Dependencies.
